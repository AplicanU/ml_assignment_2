# Assignment 2 — ML Model Comparison

## Problem Statement

Financial institutions often conduct marketing campaigns to promote long-term investment products such as term deposits. However, contacting every customer is costly and inefficient, making it important to identify individuals who are most likely to subscribe.

This assignment addresses a binary classification problem using the UCI Bank Marketing Dataset. The objective is to develop and evaluate multiple machine learning models to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on demographic attributes, financial indicators, and prior campaign interaction data.

By leveraging historical campaign data containing both numerical and categorical features, the task aims to compare the predictive performance of six machine learning algorithms — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost — using standard evaluation metrics including Accuracy, AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC).

The outcomes of this analysis will provide insight into which modeling approaches are most effective for marketing response prediction, supporting data-driven decision making in targeted customer outreach.
